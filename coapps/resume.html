      I opted Computer Science and Engineering.I will be committed to my responsibilities and show up consistently, ready to contribute my best effort.
      I will collaborate effectively with others, offering support and cooperation to achieve common goals. I can communicate openly and respectfully with colleagues.
      I have an internal drive to excel and take pride in their work, even when external rewards or recognition may be limited.
